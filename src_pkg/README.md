## AccessMod 5 local R package

This folder include archives of R packages to be installed in local lib, if missing, or in case of update. As we need specific version of some non-CRAN library, we provide code source of those library here, without messing with submodules/subtree. 

### TODO

There is certainly better way to handle this. If you have an idea, please leave a request in AccessMod_shiny issues manager on github.

In stable/production version, we should only use released package from CRAN.
