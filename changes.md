## List of changes in AccessMod
- 5.6.4 - 2019-05-24
     - Improvement
        - Added scale bar in the interactive map, as requested in #222 
- 5.6.3 - 2019-05-24
     - Bugs fix
        - Solve issue #238 [ 2019-05-15 - 2019-05-24 ] except one point : hard coded string.
        - Solve issue where the table filter tool was not rendering the correct select value list. 
- 5.6.2 - 2019-05-17
     - Bug fixes
        - Add land cover to the stack : imported labels from a table were overwritting the original labels. This was not wanted : see #237 [ 2019-05-15 - 2019-05-17]
        - Accessibility Modules : list of output data should not include internal files
        - Merge Land cover module : fixes double list input that does not update when the user click on 'skip all' or 'use all' see #236 [ 2019-05-15 - 2019-05-17]
        - Button width not correct #240 [ 2019-05-15 - 2019-05-17]
     - Improvement
        - Optimisation: Added memoize function to avoid too much latency in validation process
- 5.6.1 - 2019-05-17
     - Improvement
        - The tool for checking the remote server availability in the update script was based on ping command – it uses ICMP and this protocol seems to be blocked in many networks. If this tool fails, AccessMod can't be updated. This has been changed for another tool based on TCP: it should work better.
        - A small script has been written to automate version updating. It should help to prevent unversionned commits in the repository.
        - Fix some typos in this file.
- 5.6.0 - 2019-04-26
     - New feature
        - Multiple language support. For now, French and English are available.
        - Module to relocate facilities by hand (e.g. out of barriers) using a graphical interface
     - Improvements
        - Better performance. Inputs are now populated on demand to avoid full validation.
        - A new button is available in settings, under the expert panel. If pressed, AccessMod will be forced to update. This could solve an issue when AccessMod can't be updated with the standard update mechanism : corrupted project, manual modifications or similar cases.
        - The table system has been updated. It should solve many issues - not always reported - regarding style and performance. 
     - Bug fix
        - Solve bugs #231 [ 2019-04-24 - 2019-04-26 ] In Geographic coverage, if a facility with invalid capacity were encountered, the application crashed. There is now a new validation rule that warns the user of such a case.
- 5.3.2 - 2018-12-14
     - Improvement
        - Referral : keep ties in "closest by time", AccessMod should not decide, user does.
     - Bug fixes
        - Solved issues in facilities selection in the referral module.
        - New referral module did not export correct columns order in some tables
        - Memory management was not optimal in parallel jobs : split memory allowed by job.
        - If empty referral by time – out of reach facilities – don't try to compute a network.
- 5.3.1 - 2018-12-07
     - Improvement
        - Added progression bar for parallel processing in referral module
- 5.3.0 - 2018-11-30
     - Improvement 
        - Added parallel handling for parallel computing in referral module
- 5.2.6 - 2018-11-01
     - Rollback
        - Removed option for raster type in output in the data module
- 5.2.5 - 2018-11-01
    - Bug fix
        - In the accessibility module, when selecting a large number of facilities, around 18'000 facilities, an internal library was failing to process the request. The script produced a silent error – that was successfully reproduced manually outside AccessMod. This error should have been written in a file, but that operation also failed. This last error was reported to the AccessMod user : 'Error in file(con, "r") cannot open the connection'.  As AccessMod can't solve this directly, a workaround has been implemented : instead of subsetting a group of selected facilities, if the unselected facilities group is smaller, AccessMod will simply not select the unselected facilities. Doing this, the process will not fail. See issue #209.
- 5.2.4 - 2018-10-31
    - Improvement
        - Output travel time as an integer to solve huge output files. See issue #207 [ 2018-10-18 - 2018-10-31 ]. If a maximum travel time of 0 is set, the maximum travel time computed will be 32767 minutes ( or 22 days, 18 hours and 7 minutes ). Any value bigger will be coded -1. If the maximum travel time set is bigger than 32767, we use 2147483647 as the ultimate limit, which is about 4085 years. Any value bigger will be coded -1.

- 5.2.3 - 2018-10-26
    - Improvement
        - Solve issue #164 [ 2017-01-27 - 2018-10-26 ] where classes were editable in land cover table.  
        - Solve issue #181 [ 2017-11-02 - 2018-10-26 ], a typo.
- 5.2.2 - 2018-10-06
    - Bug fixes
        - Solve issue #202 [ 2018-10-05 - 2018-10-06 ]. Population coverage estimation in zonal statistics module could have been wrong by a little less than a minute : instead of showing population coverage according to the selected travel time value, the table included statistics for isochrone lower than value plus one, instead of lower than or equal to the value. This was occurring only when the maximum travel time value in the input layer was greater than the selected value in the input field of the module. Example: if the user selected a 120 minutes travel time and launched a zonal statistic on 60 minutes, the population coverage would have included population within an isochronal area up to 60.99 minutes instead of 60 minutes. 
- 5.2.1 - 2018-09-21
    - New feature
        - It's now possible to set speed of 0 Km/h in the scenario table. See #197 [ 2018-09-15 - 2018-09-21 ]. Speed of zero is considered as a barrier and will be acting like so. Selection of facilities located on such 0 Km/h cells are not allowed. A new column "amOnZero" in the facility table allows users to identify those facilities falling on zero speed cells.
- 5.2.0 - 2018-08-24
    - New feature
        - Correct for the population on barrier. This tool will remove population data located on land cover merged barriers and redistribute it within administrative zones. 
- 5.1.18 - 2018-07-09
    - Improvements
        - Estimation of disk space and memory needed to compute a cycle of travel time analysis is now visible in the validation panel of all accessibility based analysis. This is an estimation and not an absolute value. This is a complement to 5.1.16, where the estimation was used just before the analysis to prevent data corruption or memory shortage. 
        - Archive list: changed alphabetical order to date. Issue #192 [ 2018-06-28 - 2018-07-09 ].
    - Bug fixes 
        - Issue #193 [ 2018-06-28 – 2018-07-09 ] The export of a dataset containing infinite travel time caused by faulty DEM produced an error when exporting the file. A new limit in possible travel time set to 2^1024 seconds will prevent the issue, as inf numbers will be ignored, while keeping a large possible output values still possible.
- 5.1.17 - 2018-06-29
    - Improvements
        - In settings panel, added a tool to visualize disk space used and available in the volume where AccessMod stores its data.
    - Bug fixes
        - Some hidden temporary files were not removed properly. Added a function to force removal. Related to issues #183, #140, #175
- 5.1.16 - 2018-06-29
    - Improvements
        - Write logs in isotropic and anisotropic analysis : disk and memory expected values and what is available at the start.
        - Stop analysis before launching a process that would have taken too much resources
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved issue #191 [ 2018-06-27 - 2018-06-29 ], #182 [ 2017-11-06 - 2018-06-29 ] when processes were killed after memory outages. Lower memory attribution to processes.

- 5.1.15 - 2018-06-11
    - Improvements
        - Module data : added a checkbox button to filter datasets from the latest analysis.It will be displayed only after an analysis.
    - Bug fixes 
        - Re-enabled log modules

- 5.1.14 - 2018-06-10
    - Improvements 
        - Added rewritten filters system in the data manager. UI did not change.
        - A new way to select data computed after an analysis. The previous method had some issue: new computed data was sometimes selected unexpectedly after a filtering process.

- 5.1.13 - 2018-06-08
    - Improvements
        - Removed server side filters (replaced by the quick selection bar above each table)
        - Observer isolation : all observers are paused until the corresponding tab is loaded;
        - Added prefix option for archive file name creation 
        - Added a button to delete archives
        - New toolbox tab with "merge land cover" tool and "raster preview"; minor changes; 
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved issue #188 [ 2018-03-10 - 2018-06-08 ]: an error was raised when the same id was present in both "from" and "to" facility selection set, resulting in lost facilities referral evaluation 

- 5.1.12 - 2018-05-02
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved selector list creation issue in handsontable when undefined values / null values found in array.

- 5.1.11 - 2018-04-06
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved selection of multiple data to export 

- 5.1.10 - 2018-02-26
    - Improvements
        - Added basic tool to simplify facilities selection in tables, client side.
