## List of changes in AccessMod

- 5.1.18 - 2018-07-09
    - Improvements
        - An estimation of disk space and memory needed to compute a cycle of travel time analysis is now visible in the validation panel of all accessibility based analysis. This is an estimation and not an absolute value. This is a complement to 5.1.16, where the estimation was used just before the analysis to prevent data corruption or memory shortage. 
        - Archive list, changed alphabetical order to date. Issue #192 [ 2018-06-28 - 2018-07-09 ].
    - Bug fixes 
        - Issue #193 [ 2018-06-28 â€“ 2018-07-09 ] The export of a dataset containing infinite travel time caused by faulty DEM produced an error when exporting the file. A new limit in possible travel time set to 2^1024 seconds will prevent the issue, as inf number will be ignored, while keeping a large possible output values still possible.
- 5.1.17 - 2018-06-29
    - Improvements
        - In settings panel, added a tool to visualize disk space used and available in the volume where AccessMod stores its data.
    - Bug fixes
        - Some hidden Temporary files were not removed properly. Added a function to force removal. Related to issues #183, #140, #175
- 5.1.16 - 2018-06-29
    - Improvements
        - Write logs in isotropic and anisotropic analysis : disk and memory expected values and what is available at start.
        - Stop analysis before launching a process that would have took too much ressources
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved issue #191 [ 2018-06-27 - 2018-06-29 ], #182 [ 2017-11-06 - 2018-06-29 ] when processes were killed after memory outage. Lower memory attribution to processes.

- 5.1.15 - 2018-06-11
    - Improvements
        - Module data : added a checkbox button to filter datasets from the latest analysis.It will be displayed only after an anlysis.
    - Bug fixes 
        - Re-enabled logs modules

- 5.1.14 - 2018-06-10
    - Improvements 
        - Added rewritten filters system in the data manager. UI did not change.
        - New way to select data computed after an analysis. The previous method had some issue: new computed data was sometimes selected unexpectedly after a filtering process

- 5.1.13 - 2018-06-08
    - Improvements
        - Removed server side filters (replaced by the quick selection bar above each table)
        - Observer isolation : all observers are paused until the corresponding tab is loaded;
        - Added prefix option for archives file name creation 
        - Added a button to delete archive
        - New toolbox tab with "merge landover" tool and "raster preview"; minor changes; 
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved issue #188 [ 2018-03-10 - 2018-06-08 ]: an error was raised when the same id was present in both "from" and "to" facility selection set, resulting in lost facilities referral evaluation 

- 5.1.12 - 2018-05-02
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved selector list creation issue in handsontable when undefined values / null values found in array.

- 5.1.11 - 2018-04-06
    - Bug fixes
        - Solved selection of multiple data to export 

- 5.1.10 - 2018-02-26
    - Improvements
        - Added basic tool to simplify facilities selection in tables, client side.
